# Processing

I started making a game for Android (Altough currently is sized for desktop). This is just a mockup I prepared in half an hour before sleep. I will work on this hopefully.

### Running the app

* Get Processing IDE from https://processing.org and run. (Sorry but currently not in Java App form)
* You can also compile in Android with an editor like APDE. To do this you need to remove `size(width, height)` and may have to fiddle with sprite sizes.
